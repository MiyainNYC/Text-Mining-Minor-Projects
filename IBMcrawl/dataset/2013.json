The PureFlex solution will allow SCGC to analyze seven times more seismic data than before, enabling the exploration of larger oil and gas fields, while reducing the environmental footprint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "SCGC, part of a Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Limited and a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), provides engineering and technical services to the international oil and gas industry in China, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and Ecuador. Its services span a broad range of areas including: engineering and geological research; geophysical survey; drilling engineering; down hole services; mud logging, well logging and perforating; oil and gas field engineering construction and development; and oil/gas field cooperative development. In 2012 CNPC, one of the world's largest exploration companies, produced 110 million metric tons, up 2.79 million metric tons from a year earlier. According to a research institute affiliated with China National Petroleum Corp., China's oil demand in 2013 is expected to rise to 514 million metric tons, up 4.8 percent over last year. \u00a0", "\"Today many of the systems and processes associated the oil and gas industry are not efficient enough to be sustainable. For example, an oil field exploration can generate one terabyte of data daily, and a petroleum engineer may devote up to 70 percent or more of his or her time mining this data\", says Deng Yali, Deputy Chief Engineer, SCGC. \"In order to increase our seismic imaging capabilities, reduce the risk of drilling \u201cdry holes\u201d and leverage our vast geographical region faster, we need to analyze at least seven times more data and do that much faster than before.\"\u00a0", "To help meet this goal and implement the new IT infrastructure, SCGC worked with IBM and Sichuan Zhonglu Technology & Trader Co., Ltd. The solution runs the CAD/CAE professional software on IBM Flex System x240, PureFlex p750, Flex System Chassis and uses IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) - a high-performance storage enterprise file management platform. The new smarter computing infrastructure can integrate seismic and geologic data from multiple sources and use advanced data modeling. \u00a0", "As a result, SCGC can now be more precise in locating remote resources thus avoiding \"dry hole\" drilling. A data analysis cycle now takes approximately a week - a process that took 27 days to complete before. Analytics, optimization and virtualization techniques can render larger amounts of complex data in more intuitive ways, allowing engineers to improve their decision making and, ultimately, their production effectiveness. These new capabilities can help increase the utilization of the existing gas and oil fields. Given the enormous price tag of drilling a new well and the complexity of managing production facilities, even modest increases in oil exploration and production efficiency could tremendously improve energy affordability.\u00a0", "\"The oil and gas companies in the future will rely not only on natural resources, but also on their ability to develop a clear focus on building adaptive business models and deploying strategic technologies.\" said Dominic Tong, Vice President, Systems & Technology Group, IBM Greater China Group.\u00a0\"The IBM PureSystems solution we delivered to Sichuan Geophysical Company of Petroleum Administration Bureau enables a new level of analytical insight that fits with client\u2019s need for cost effectiveness, sustainability and faster time-to-market.\u201d\u00a0", "The IBM PureSystems family offers clients an alternative to current enterprise computing models, where multiple and disparate systems require significant resources to set up and maintain.

The software helps each of these school systems make smarter decisions on how their physical assets, such as school buildings and facilities, are used.\u00a0", "With more than 95 percent of schools across the United States experiencing significant budget cuts as high as 20\u00a0percent, schools are learning to do more with less resources than ever.", " To make this easier, IBM technology is creating new opportunities for each of these school districts to more efficiently use existing facilities. \u00a0", "By discovering how efficiently physical assets are being used \u2013 and finding new uses for its buildings \u2013 schools are able to reallocate resources to instructional purposes, save costs and have the potential to generate new revenue opportunities.\u00a0", "With nearly 178,000 students and 4,500 hundred acres of land, the School District of Palm Beach County\u00a0is the 11th largest school district in the United States. Facing increased pressure to cut costs and add revenue to offset reduced budgets, SDPBC used campus vacancies during non-school hours to provide nearly 3000 room and building leases annually to commercial and non-profit organizations. Although the program generates additional revenue for the district, the manual leasing and contract processes proved to be time consuming and expensive to maintain.\u00a0", "To better manage this cost and reduce administrative paperwork, SDPBC implemented IBM TRIRIGA across its 187 schools. Since rolling out the solution, the district has increased leasing revenue and it is expected to generate $4.5 million this year by better utilizing its buildings, streamlining the leasing process and modernizing its management capabilities.\u00a0", "\u201cThe ability for the School District of Palm Beach County to generate additional revenue is incredibly impactful, since those funds are reinvested toward improving campuses and providing the best education tools to our students, including the highest quality teachers,\u201d said Joseph Sanches, Chief of Support Operations for SDPBC. \u201cIBM\u2019s smarter buildings solution allows us to manage costs across\u00a0building equipment\u00a0and maintenance, maximize our facilities usage, and ensure a fair return on the Palm Beach County taxpayers' investment.\u201d\u00a0", "The foundation for creating smarter schools starts with doing more with what already exists. Buildings within Portland Public Schools, the largest district in the Pacific Northwest, are on average nearly 70-years-old. This makes bringing modern technologies into classrooms across the nine million square feet school district to be increasingly challenging. Using IBM TRIRIGA, PPS is able to prioritize modernization efforts throughout their schools, which is a critical element when determining budgets. The smarter buildings software also helps PPS create more intelligent, predictive and efficient maintenance policies and practices. \u00a0", "As a result, PPS can now quickly and accurately identify locations where structural updates are required within classrooms, increase the speed at which schools fix broken lights, pipes and other infrastructure, and\u00a0predict when general repairs are needed. For example, if a water main breaks in one of the schools, the system automatically alerts the maintenance department about the location and type of problem, enabling a quick response\u00a0with the appropriate tools for repairs. The increased awareness about repairs across the 81 schools in the district has enabled PPS to reduce facilities management costs by 15 percent while improving speed of modernization by 46 percent.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u201cUpdating our campus facilities is a significant priority for the district, but the time and resources required to do this effectively can be demanding,\u201d said Andy Fridley, Data Analyst of Portland Public Schools. \u201cBy finding a quick and efficient way to identify and predict which areas on campus require attention, we\u2019re able to fast-track our modernization efforts while also achieving cost savings on reactive maintenance.\u201d\u00a0", "IBM\u2019s smarter buildings technology can provide any system with the analytics capability for predictive maintenance, but it also provides the tools to help staff make smarter, more efficient decisions. That\u2019s what Clark County School District in Las Vegas was looking for when they chose IBM to help update their outdated maintenance systems and practices. As the fifth largest school district in the country, CCSD is responsible for operating safe and efficient schools across 36 million square feet of building space. IBM Maximo software allows the district to prioritize, respond to and repair more than 110,000 work orders generated each year at CCSD\u2019s 392 schools and administrative buildings, across 8,000 square miles. \u00a0", "Analytics also give CCSD the insights needed to predict and prevent future maintenance issues. During one instance, the school noticed a slight change in usage of one building\u2019s heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. This fluctuation\u00a0was analyzed against normal usage and an alert about the abnormality was sent to staff, preventing a massive electrical issue that would have caused thousands of students to be transferred.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u201cIBM\u2019s software enabled Clark County to go from just reacting to emergency work orders to making data-driven, even predictive decisions on maintenance requests,\u201d said Cynthia Atterberry, Work Management Coordinator, Clark County School District. \u201cThis allows us to provide a safer and more efficient environment for our 310,000 students, because in some cases we are able to get ahead of repairs before they are needed or a crisis situation arises.\u201d\u00a0", "CCSD is using IBM\u2019s Smarter Buildings software to gain visibility across its entire 8,000 square mile district.
