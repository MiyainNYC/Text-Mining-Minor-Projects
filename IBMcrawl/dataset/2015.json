In a two-year, 8.6-million euro pilot, scientists will test Identity Mixer in two scenarios: in Germany with the Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (DRK, or the German Red Cross), and with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia\u2019s national science agency.", "As a major provider for regional home emergency call and social services in Germany, the DRK delivers tailored social care services to their customers 24/7, including emergency services, assisted mobility, housekeeping and nursing assistance. The organization has four million volunteers and professional staff, 52 hospitals and more than 500 nursing homes operated worldwide.", "In the AU2EU pilot, 20 DRK test participants in the southwest of Germany will be equipped with sensors for in-home activity and status monitoring. The data gathered from these sensors will be transferred to a dedicated cloud server, where the data will be analyzed to determine the type of assistance required. In addition, DRK field representatives will be provided with a mobile device to collect and register sensitive customer data, such as medical records, medication and family contacts, to establish a service contract. Identity Mixer will be used to keep all of this data confidential and private. The technology will be implemented by NEC Europe and Tunstall Healthcare **.", "\u201cOur goal today, as it has been for 150 years, is to offer help to victims of conflicts and disasters as well as to other vulnerable people and to provide support at home, transport and mobility aids to help people when they face a crisis in their daily lives. New technologies play an increasingly important role in realizing this help, particularly for our home emergency alarm service,\u201d said Caroline Greiner, the district manager of the German Red Cross for Rhein-Neckar/Heidelberg e.V.\u00a0 \u201cHere we offer services to senior citizens that allow them to remain at home and in conformable and familiar settings.

To maintain the nation\u2019s disease-free status, the Australian government, along with key partners, has developed an emergency rapid response plan to take action quickly before an outbreak spreads. This plan involves swiftly bringing together government, academic and other research organizations, along with industry partners into a secure, trustworthy online collaborative environment that facilitates evidence-based decision making. Using Identity Mixer, the pilot will help facilitate the secure sharing of sensitive information in a timely matter across several remote locations and among collaborating partners.", "\u201cSpeed and responding rapidly to disease incidents are absolutely vital towards saving the lives of both humans and animals,\u201d said John Zic, principal research scientist, CSIRO. \u201cUsing the advanced technologies in this pilot, we expect to see gains in the ability to respond, while still maintaining the security, privacy and trust required to be effective.\u201d", "Peters adds, \u201dIdentity Mixer is an example of why legislation around data privacy across the globe should enable \u2014 not stifle \u2014 innovation.
